Hi
I am Filipp,
Front-End developer.
I can create websites using html5, css3 and javascript. You can read my recommendations on my github page.

The unique structure of each project teaches me new things with different experiences. I enjoy using and developing what new things I've learned. If you would like to talk about your projects, you can contact me using the links below.
